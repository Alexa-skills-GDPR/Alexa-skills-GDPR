Willard Beach is a small sand and pebble beach tucked between Fisherman’s Point and the campus of Southern Maine Community College in a quiet neighborhood of South Portland. Just four acres in size, the beach hugs Simonton Cove and is enjoyed immensely by visitors and locals alike. Spread out in the sun and take in the views of Cushing Island and Ram Island Light in Casco Bay. Go for a refreshing swim, breathe in the salty air, listen to the buoys clang offshore and watch the ferries ply the waters of the bay. The bathhouse is open in summer, and has restrooms, a snack bar and showers.

""SCP-005"" by Unknown Author, from the SCP Wiki. File content:  Item #: SCP-005 Object Class: Safe Special Containment Procedures: SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area. Description: In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined. Additional Notes: SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only under the supervision of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for any personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will result in immediate termination. Appendix A: While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.

""SCP-042"" by Unknown Author, rewritten by Skali Sharpnose, from the SCP Wiki. File content:  Item #: SCP-042 Object Class: Safe Special Containment Procedures: SCP-042 is currently housed within Minimum Security Paddock 12 at Bio-Research Area-32. Despite SCP-042's seeming disinclination to attempt escape at this point, security measures must still be maintained at all times. Previous attempts to maintain the health of the groundcover in Paddock 12 have failed to date. Despite regular watering, SCP-042's presence leaves the ground parched wherever it treads. As it has not been determined what happens to added water, the program of watering has been discontinued as unnecessary and potentially hazardous to the local water table. Monitoring of local well levels and sampling of the area's water is to be carried out on a weekly basis. Personnel interacting with SCP-042, including any handlers, medical personnel, feeders, and custodial staff, must submit to a thorough search, including [DATA REDACTED], prior to entrance into Paddock 12. Any personnel attempting to smuggle a weapon, or an object which can be used as a weapon, is to be immediately [DATA REDACTED]. Personnel are to undergo psychological screening once per week after interacting in any way with SCP-042. Medical personnel examining the wounds on SCP-042's back are to be closely monitored at all times, lest they attempt to euthanize SCP-042. Description: SCP-042 is an animal believed to be a member of the genus Equus. Its coat is white in color with some small brown spotting. It stands at 183 cm (18 hands) to its withers and weighs 710 kg. Its weight has dropped significantly since it has been in Foundation custody, due to both atrophy from lack of physical activity and refusal to eat. The liquid nutrient diet forcibly administered keeps it alive but it remains emaciated and weak. SCP-042 exhibits two large bone protrusions from its back, linked to powerful musculature (now atrophied) throughout its back. These bones end at 37 centimeters from the surface of its back, and they protrude from the skin at open, ragged wounds. To date, no healing has been observed of these wounds, though some clotting must be taking place for SCP-042 to have not bled out. SCP-042 exhibits a listless demeanor and has been unresponsive to any attempt by skilled handlers to incite activity. If allowed to do so, SCP-042 will lay down on the ground immobile, not moving to eat, drink, or relieve itself. Pain-response conditioning has proved somewhat effective in getting SCP-042 to rise so that it can be cleaned, but eventually it will attempt to lay down again no matter the strength of the shock administered, even to the point of losing consciousness. Researchers are divided as to SCP-042's level of intelligence. While some believe that it is simply an animal and no smarter than others of its genus, others have come to believe that it may in fact be sapient. It has been shown to make eye contact with persons entering Paddock 12, most of whom describe its looks as ""pleading"". SCP-042 has been involved in accidents on multiple occasions where it has been injured on pieces of equipment or its enclosure, which those arguing for intelligence believe to have been intentionally caused by SCP-042. Addendum: A request was submitted by Dr. P------ to transfer SCP-042 to Bio-Research Area-4 on -/--/19--, which was approved by O5-5. Dr. P------ altered transportation documents to indicate that SCP-042 was to be airlifted rather than transported by armed convoy. During transit, Dr. P------ overpowered the pilot of the transport aircraft and took the controls, plunging the craft into a steep dive. Passengers and cargo experienced nearly a minute of weightlessness before security personnel regained control of the aircraft and leveled off. As Dr. P------ was being bound and the plane landed, SCP-042 broke free of containment and kicked two security personnel to death in the cargo area. Cargo bay security footage shows that after this point, SCP-042 approached Dr. P------ and touched its muzzle to his face. If I should continue with the file please say: NEXT!",next!
B09BFF691V,Alexa open secure contain protect,"Dr. P------ exhibited signs of euphoria while contact was maintained, but when additional security personnel subdued SCP-042 with tranquilizer darts and contact was broken, he collapsed into a catatonic state from which he did not recover. After a hearing concerning his actions, Dr. P------ was euthanized while under Foundation medical care on --/--/19-- If you want to listen to more item files say ITEM.","yes, item."

""SCP-007"" by Unknown Author, from the SCP Wiki. File content:  Item #: SCP-007 Object Class: Euclid Special Containment Procedures: SCP-007 is to be contained in a sealed room measuring 10 m on each side. Room is to be furnished comfortably as a living area, along with whatever items are requested by --------------- (hereafter referred to as Subject), given that providing Subject with requested items would not compromise security. Subject is not to be allowed to leave the room, and is to be detained with force if necessary. Description: SCP-007 is located within a cavity in the abdomen of Subject. Subject is a Caucasian male, physically approximately 25 years of age (subject claims to be 28) and 176 cm in height. Most of Subject's abdomen (muscles, skin, and organs) is absent, though Subject does not appear to suffer because of this. Instead of normal flesh, a sphere composed of soil and water is present, though it does not actually come into contact with Subject's body at any point. The sphere appears to be, in most respects, a miniature near-duplicate of the Earth, approximately 60 cm in diameter, although continental alignment is not consistent with that of any alignment known in Earth's history. The sphere has its own weather patterns and negligible gravitational pull, in addition to microscopic organisms somewhat resembling those of modern-day Earth inhabiting it. Two intelligent species have been observed, though contact and communication with either has yet to be made. Technology levels of observed species must be checked at least once a week and, as of --/----, are approximately equal to that of 15th-Century Earth. Subject claims to be named ---------------, but no records of such a person can be found. Subject does not require food or water, and while he has been observed consuming both, what happens to such substances after being swallowed is unknown. Subject is intelligent (IQ has been measured at 128) and amiable, and regards the planet in his abdomen as a minor curiosity about his body. Subject seems to experience no stress about his unusual condition. When questioned about planet's origins, Subject replied, ""I just woke up one day, and there it was. I don't have any idea how it got there."" Subject has provided a Social Security number and driver's license number and requested that they be checked against known records. When checked, it was discovered that neither had yet been allocated. Dr. ------- has a weekly chess game with Subject, during which Subject's mental health is evaluated. Dr. ------- reports that Subject does not seem to mind the restricted living environment, and has yet to attempt to escape or show signs of violence or mental illness, though he has repeatedly requested a computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that this not be provided as it may be used to compromise security If I should continue with an other file please say: ITEM!","yes, continue."

While the two sides of Victoria Harbour are now connected by a world-class infrastructure system of road and rail tunnels, tens of millions of people still climb aboard the humble Star Ferry vessels each year. Many visitors take the ride for an up-close look at one of the world’s most photographed harbours, while locals have kept their affection for it because, even after a century, it’s still a highly reliable and efficient form of transport. National Geographic rates the Star Ferry crossing as one of 50 places of a lifetime.

As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points. The two players move their checkers in opposing directions. The players alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn. After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3, the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally. For more, say, ""Give me more details about playing backgammon"".",yes.

Don’t scrub the stain or you could push it deeper into the carpet. Next, if you have a light-colored carpet, pour some hydrogen peroxide and baking soda over the stain. Let it sit for 20 minutes, then pour water over the stain. Blot the carpet with a cloth or paper towel until the stain is no longer visible. Since hydrogen peroxide can bleach dark-colored carpets, you can also use white vinegar and liquid dish soap instead. First, mix 2 cups (½ a liter) of water with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) each of vinegar and dish soap. Then, saturate a sponge with the solution, and blot the stain until it disappears.",blot stain.

The message reads:  Experiencing a sense of inner peace, while living in the noise and bustle of a major metropolis, is possible.  Whatever happens in the outer world, we can turn at any time to the silence of our being—the Christ Presence within, through prayer and meditation, to reconnect with our essence of peace.  The opportunity to spend time away from the busyness of life, is a blessing and a gift.  To find that place of stillness, we must first tune out external sounds, and with confidence and faith, tune in to the creative silence at the heart of our being.  We reconnect with God’s life-giving presence.  In a peaceful inner space, we are nourished and supplied with all that we need to return to the outer world.  The Bible verse is first Peter three four:  Let your adornment be the inner self, with the lasting beauty of a gentle, and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God’s sight.",silent reflection.

Please let me share more with you about Jesus's Divine Mercy:  To The Full.  St. Faustina recorded in her diary her encounters with our Lord.  In chapters 1292 and 1707, St. Faustina wrote quote 'When I received Holy Communion, I said to Him, “Jesus, I thought about You so many times last night,” and Jesus answered me, And I thought of you before I called you into being. “Jesus, in what way were You thinking about me?” In terms of admitting you to My eternal happiness. After these words, my soul was flooded with the love of God. I could not stop marveling at how much God loves us (Diary, 1292).  On my way to the veranda, I went into the chapel for a moment. My heart was plunged in profound adoration, praising God’s incomprehensible goodness and His mercy. Then I heard these words in my soul: I am and will be for you such as you praise Me for being. You shall experience My goodness, already in this life and then, to the full, in the life to come (Diary, 1707).'     Let us pray,  Lord Jesus, may I think of You and praise and thank You more fervently and constantly in anticipation of what You have prepared in heaven for me and all those who love You!

B07ZTWXK15,"Alexa, Ask Dog Breeds to show me a Golden Retriever","This yellow-coated dog can at times be a complete clown and loves to play and be active. They are kind, gentle and very eager to please. They will do anything for affection and love everyone, including strangers. This affectionate canine is the ideal family pet as they love children, adults and other animals equally. They will require proper training to become a well-adjusted member of your family. Do not leave a Golden Retriever unsupervised with younger children until they are through the adolescent phase. They can easily develop sibling rivalry and play a little too rough with children. This is not because they are jealous or mean; it is simply because they can view children as equals or littermates. Be sure to delineate children’s toys from dog toys and do not allow your children to play with dog toys unless they are playing with the dog. Your Goldie will require a lot of exercise and mental games to keep them from getting bored. Long walks, play time in the back yard and interactive toys are right up their alley. When left to their own devices for too long, expect to come home to a mess. Your active retriever can become destructive and a nuisance barker. If not properly trained, your determined dog will push the limits and can become obnoxious. Behaviors that can develop include barking, digging, and chewing, stealing food, taking toys from children, lapse in house training and jumping. The Golden is a product of their environment. Homes where they are active and social with the family are ideal. This involved pooch will become a well-adjusted member of the family and be extremely happy and ready to please. Homes where they are left alone for long periods of time or where proper training is not provided are not ideal as they will become destructive and unhappy.",very active.

If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a six, the turn passes to the next player. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled.
