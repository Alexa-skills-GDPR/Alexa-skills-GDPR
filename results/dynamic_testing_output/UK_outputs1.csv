Naturalization Civics Test. The questions omitted vary from person to person or by election-cycle and can be found at u s c i s.gov.  Would you like to begin?,yes
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",What is the supreme law of the land?,constitution.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",The supreme law of the land is the Constitution. Would you like me to tell you more about the Constitution?,"yes, please."
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.","The Founding Fathers of the United States wrote the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution is the “supreme law of the land.” The U.S. Constitution has lasted longer than any other country’s constitution. It establishes the basic principles of the United States government. The Constitution establishes a system of government called “representative democracy.” In a representative democracy, citizens choose representatives to make the laws. U.S. citizens also choose a president to lead the executive branch of government. The Constitution lists fundamental rights for all citizens and other people living in the United States. Laws made in the United States must follow the Constitution. Ready for the next question?",yes
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",What does the Constitution do?,creates laws.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.","The Constitution sets up the government, defines the government, and protects the rights of the American people. You will only need to provide one of these answers on the test.  Woud you like to learn more?","yes, please."
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.","The Constitution of the United States divides government power between the national government and state governments. The name for this division of power is “federalism.” Federalism is an important idea in the Constitution. We call the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution the “Framers” of the Constitution. The Framers wanted to limit the powers of the government, so they separated the powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Constitution explains the power of each branch. The Constitution also includes changes and additions, called “amendments.” The first 10 amendments are called the “Bill of Rights.” The Bill of Rights established the individual rights and liberties of all Americans. Ready for the next question?",yes
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the Constitution. What are these words?,we the people.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",The first three words of the Constitution are We the People. Would you like to learn more?,"yes, sure."
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.","“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” With the words “We the People,” the Constitution states that the people set up the government. The government works for the people and protects the rights of people. In the United States, the power to govern comes from the people, who are the highest power. This is called “popular sovereignty.” The people elect representatives to make laws. Ready for the next question?","yes, ready."
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",What is an amendment?,legal change.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",What is an amendment?,it changes.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.","An amendment is a change or addition to the Constitution. The Framers of the Constitution knew that laws can change as a country grows. They did not want to make it too easy to modify the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. The Framers also did not want the Constitution to lose its meaning. For this reason, the Framers decided that Congress could pass amendments in only two ways: by a two-thirds vote in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives or by a special convention. A special convention has to be requested by two-thirds of the states. After an amendment has passed in Congress or by a special convention, the amendment must then be ratified (accepted) by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. The amendment can also be ratified by a special convention in three-fourths of the states. Not all proposed amendments are ratified. Six times in U.S. history amendments have passed in Congress but were not approved by enough states to be ratified. Ready for the next question?",yes
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",What do we call the first ten amendments to the Constitution?,bill of rights.
B08BHKV9CL,"Alexa, open citizenship test.",The first ten amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights. Would you like to learn more about the Bill of Rights?,"yes, please."

B07L87HP8M,"Alexa, open civics primer","Welcome to civics primer...Separation of powers under the United States Constitution. Separation of powers is a political doctrine according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. Which would you like to cover first...Congress, the President, or the Supreme Court. To exit say stop.",congress.
B07L87HP8M,"Alexa, open civics primer","Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States. Under the non-delegation doctrine, Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case Clinton v. The city of New York,  
 that Congress could not delegate a ""line-item veto"" to the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.
Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was Wayman v. Southard  (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between ""important"" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that ""a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details.""
Marshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930's that the Supreme Court held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of the National Recovery Administration called A.L.A. Schechtes, (1935), Congress could not authorize the president to formulate codes of ""fair competition."" It was held that Congress must set some standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has deemed that phrases such as ""just and reasonable,"" ""public interest"" and ""public convenience"" suffice.

B07L87HP8M,"Alexa, open civics primer","Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States. Under the non-delegation doctrine, Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case Clinton v. The city of New York,  
 that Congress could not delegate a ""line-item veto"" to the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.
Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was Wayman v. Southard  (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between ""important"" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that ""a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details.""
Marshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930's that the Supreme Court held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of the National Recovery Administration called A.L.A. Schechtes, (1935), Congress could not authorize the president to formulate codes of ""fair competition."" It was held that Congress must set some standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has deemed that phrases such as ""just and reasonable,"" ""public interest"" and ""public convenience"" suffice.

B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Governing law provisions, also known as choice of law, are different from choice of venue provisions. Choice of law identifies the substantive law under which the contract should be interpreted.  Choice of venue identifies the location. You can use nexus words to narrow or broaden to what the choice of law applies. We use ""arising under or relating to"" to broaden the nexus. In the U.S., we have 50 state laws and 50 states to file suit. There are benefits to having both governing law and venue in the same jurisdiction. You simplify the legal proceedings and avoid some potential conflicts between substantive and procedural laws.. Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Avoid having a company's division sign contracts. Contracts are binding commitments between two legal entities.  A division of a company is not a legal entity. It's an internal unit used by the company to segment a part of its operations. Divisions have no independent authority to sign a contract. If the counterparty insists, identify the division in the recitals but avoid making it a party to a contract.. Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Avoid mixing up software as a service (or SaaS) and software license agreement terms. They both involve the use of software functionality, but the rights and obligations are very different. SaaS agreements offer customers access to the programs, while software licenses share copies of the software itself. One difference is the intellectual property license. SaaS users may not need a copyright license to access and use the software. Another difference may be the payment terms. With SaaS, the payment structure is standardized across its customers, with fees tied to the term of use, functionality used, and the number of end users. The third difference is sublicense and distribution rights. Most SaaS agreements have strict terms on who and how many people can access the service. Software licenses provide a wider range of options for licensing, including sublicense and distribution rights.. Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - We regularly update our contract forms regularly. We do this to fix mistakes, adapt to changing standards, and reflect evolving company priorities. I've found that most companies do not have a systematic approach to updating their templates. One way to manage template updates is to identify an owner and include it in the job description. Another approach schedule a regular meeting to discuss updates to the  templates. These could be each quarter or every six months. The last way to to create a regular system for running and collecting redlines. You could use email, Slack channel or Sharepoint to collect needed changes. . Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - When negotiating product warranty periods, pay attention to the length of time. First, watch the start date. Delivery date as a start may not work as well when delivery extends over a period of time or doesn't reflect the first productive use. Second, consider adding extended service plans. These plans give customers a longer period than the vendor would have offered otherwise. Third, pay attention to the customer's plans. If the customer is a distributor or reseller, they may want the warranty to start at installation or delivery of the item to the end user. . Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Use a shorter set of boilerplate provisions short low-risk contracts. Here's our approach: We never sacrifice limit of liability, governing law, no waiver, and entire agreement provisions. They are on the must-have list in every deal. We include indemnity in any deal of significance, but may remove in low-risk deals with individuals and small companies. When the contract is short, we may remove third-party beneficiary, no Oral Modification, Severability, Further Assurances, and Independent Contractors. I also may leave out assignment, Choice of Venue, Notice, Counterparts, and Force Majeure, as these concepts are already covered by common law. . Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?","yes, please."
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Most definitions of confidential information exclude any information independently developed without use of the Confidential Information. If you are primarily the discloser, you'll want to narrow this exception by defining what  ""independently developed "" means. If you are primarily a receiver, especially if you are working on similar technology, you want to give yourself a lot of room by broadening the exception. You also may want to include a residuals clause, which allows for use of information remembered by your personnel. . Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Be careful creating one-way provisions in your templates. It may be tempting to create that kind of template. Counterparties often insist on making provisions mutual. You may find yourself having to agree to that overreaching provision we tried to impose just on them. If you still want unilateral provisions, consider making only part of the section that way.. Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Avoid super-secret expiration and termination dates. Some contracts read like a mystery novel. The term language uses an elusive concept instead of an actual date. The term ends when all obligations are performed. Uh, ok.  Good luck figuring that out. No one will be able to track the end date during the term or after. What obligations are we talking about? Does that mean only delivery obligations? What about indemnification? Or no publicity? This Agreement will automatically terminate, without an opportunity to cure or written notice, if Buyer materially breaches its terms. How the heck are we supposed to figure out that? Stick with clear expiration and termination dates. . Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.
B0B2WRDW25,"Alexa, open contract tips","Here's your How to Contract tip - Be extra careful when your contract includes calculations using different rates. THe contract may say something like ""$50,000 US Dollars, which is approximately $61,000 Canadian Dollars."" What happens if the relationship between the numbers shifts over time? That $50,000 in U.S. Dollars may become $57,000 in Canadian Dollars. Using two calculations can cause conflict and disagreements about what the number should be. It is better to avoid these dual calculations. Just say the number one way using the preferred calculation methodology. If the counterparty insists, add the equivalent as of a specific date only, being clear which number controls.. Do you want me to read another How to Contract tip?",yes.

B07KYK2256,"Alexa, open desert survival","Welcome to desert survival tips. ""The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only."" 1. Don’t Eat Too Much

The more food you eat, the more water you will require to survive. If water is scarce (as it most likely will be), you’ll want to only eat as much as you need to keep your energy up. Any more than that and you risk using too much of your precious water supply. 2. Prepare for the Cold

If you’ve spend any time in the desert, you know the nights are every bit as cold as the days are hot. At first, this can be a welcome relief, but as the night wears on you may find yourself freezing cold. 3. Move at Night

It’s better to rest during the day and move at night. Not only does moving during the heat of the day increase your chances of becoming overheated, it also causes you to sweat, hastening dehydration. 4. Wear Sunglasses

The desert sun reflecting off the sand can be extremely hard on your eyes. Not only will it spoil your night vision for hours into the night, it can also cause severe headaches and blurry vision. 5. Keep Your Clothes on

It may be tempting to start shedding your clothes when the temperature climbs, but it’s better if you don’t. Exposing your bare skin to the sun hastens dehydration and puts you at risk of severe sunburns. 6. Wear Light Colors

Light colors reflect sunlight while dark colors absorb it. When keeping cool is a priority, the former is far more desirable than the latter. 7. Find Water, Eating cactus fruits will help keep you hydrated, however, you’ll want to be very careful because too much of it could make you sick, dehydrating you even faster. So even if you find some cactus fruit, keep searching for water.",yes.

Some side effects you may experience are belly pain, loose or hard stools, gas, dry mouth, or upset stomach.  You should call your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects are bothersome or do not go away.  You should not take this medication if you are allergic to esomeprazole.

As awesome as it would be to become the next Steve Jobs on your own, the reality is that people learn faster with mentors and peer feedback. What may seem like an immovable bug or an unlearnable topic could be quickly alleviated by a fresh pair of eyes or a new interpretation of the subject. Whether it's online or in-person, ignore the trolls and don't be afraid to ask for help, because every programmer has been in your shoes before. Besides, most developers love to code, and if there's one thing that passionate individuals enjoy, it's to share their knowledge with others. Take at least 20 minutes to figure something out on your own before asking for help. There's a good chance that the answer is already in front of you, and besides, struggling makes you a better programmer overall. ","yes, ask."

The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut. The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying: ""Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself."" And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned. Self help is the best help. Moral of the story: Heaven helps those who help themselves.",help yourself.

    Crawl low under any smoke to your exit - heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling.

    If you open a door, open it slowly. Be ready to shut it quickly if heavy smoke or fire is present.
    If you can’t get to someone needing assistance, leave the home and call 9-1-1 or the fire department. Tell the emergency operator where the person is located.
    If pets are trapped inside your home, tell firefighters right away.
    If you can’t get out, close the door and cover vents and cracks around doors with cloth or tape to keep smoke out.  Call 9-1-1 or your fire department. Say where you are and signal for help at the window with a light-colored cloth or a flashlight.
    If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop, and roll – stop immediately, drop to the ground, and cover your face with your hands.  Roll over and over or back and forth until the fire is out.  If you or someone else cannot stop, drop, and roll, smother the flames with a blanket or towel.  Use cool water to treat the burn immediately for 3 to 5 minutes.  Cover with a clean, dry cloth.

B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle"," Fleet Battle is a game very similar to ""Battleship"" - you might have played that before. It seems like it's your first game. It's best if I tell you how to play first as my rules are slightly different to those you may already know. Is that okay?","yes, okay."
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle",I'm not sure what you mean... Can you rephrase?,yes.
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Alright, here's how it works. First of all, you need a piece of paper and a pen. A ruler might come handy too! Don't worry about drawing anything now - I'll take you through this again step by step, when we start the game. You need to draw 2 grids representing ocean. Each grid must be 5 by 5 squares long. Next, you must label the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 on top of the grids and with letters aside from ""A"" to ""E""... The grid on the left is where you draw your fleet. The one on the right will be used to mark your hits and misses... That's where it gets exciting! Is that clear so far?",yes
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Great... When we have our fleets drawn on the grid, we take turns in taking a shot at each other, by calling out the coordinates of a square, for example you say: D-2. I respond with ""hit"" if it hits a ship, or ""miss"" if it misses. If you've hit the last remaining square of a ship I will announce the name of the ship, for example ""You sank my Submarine"". During the game you should record my shots on the left-hand grid where your fleet is drawn, and your shots on the right-hand grid as ""X"" for a hit and a dot for a miss. I'll tell you more details as we go. It's pretty simple. Are you ready to start?","yes, ready."
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Great, let's start! I'll take you through the setup. Step by step. Have you got a piece of paper and a pen with you?",yes
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle", Have you finished drawing the grids?,"yes, finished."
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle", Have you finished?,"yes, finished."
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Great. Now it's time to arrange your ships on the left-hand grid. There's total of 3 ships: two ""Destroyers"" and one ""Submarine"". Let's start with Destroyers. Destroyer covers 2 squares. You can draw ships horizontally or vertically, but diagonal ships are not allowed. Go ahead, draw your first Destroyer on the left-hand grid. Just outline the squares in any place you want.  Are you ready?",yes.
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Perfect. Now draw a second ""Destroyer"", also two-square in size. Attention! The rules say that the ships can't be in contact with another ship. You must leave at least 1 square gap around every ship. Now go ahead, draw your second Destroyer on your grid...  Have you got it?",yes.
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Excellent, we're nearly there. It's time for ""Submarine"". Submarines are the smallest ships - they cover only 1 square. Draw one Submarine on your grid now.  Are you ready?",yes
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle", You start. Just pick any empty field from your right-hand grid and tell me its code. For example B-2...,c-3
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle"," C-3 is a miss. Everytime when I tell you that it's a miss, mark that field with a dot. Go ahead! Mark C-3 with a dot on your right-hand grid. Now it's my turn. ""B-5""! Hit, miss or sunk?",hit
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle", Ha! I had a feeling you had a ship there! Your turn!,my turn!
B08B59ZDTJ,"Alexa, open Fleet Battle","Hmm... I didn't catch that. Say for example: ""letter D, number 3"".","letter z, number 7."

Evacuate dangerous areas immediately. You may have only a short time to escape. Act quickly, utilizing your planned route. Head to designated shelters during flood warnings. When emergency services tell you to leave, listen to their instructions. Some people think they can ride out the storm, but keep yourself safe by taking proper precautions.

    Leave everything behind. Don’t stop to move valuables. Grab your emergency kit and go.

2
Move to higher ground away from water. Whether you are on foot or have to abandon your car, higher ground is your best option. Get away from areas with storm drains, streams, creeks, or rivers. If you’re stuck at home, head for the roof.  3
Avoid crossing through water. Water up to your ankles is enough to be dangerous. You cannot see how deep the water is the rest of the way. Six inches (15.24 cm) of water is enough to reach the bottom of cars and cause stalling. 12 inches (30.48 cm) will float away most vehicles. Never try crossing standing water. 4
Stay out of moving water. Moving water is never safe to approach. The current is usually stronger than it appears and even a slight current is strong enough to carry off adults and vehicles. Most flood deaths come from people trying to drive through water. Don’t risk it. 5
Swim backwards to survive moving water. Turn over on your back instead of fighting the tide. Keep your feet positioned upstream, using them to push away from obstacles floating with you. Try to find something to hold onto, such as a strong branch or roof. Once you do this, point your feet downstream and yell for help.[9]

    Never go under debris. Keep your head above water and avoid the debris or pass over it.",got it.

I go through seas never sought before,  Where stars unknown to our native skies  Startle the mariner's watchful eyes.  Our bark shall over the waters sweep,  And rouse the children of the deep:  Around us, 'midst the silvery spray,  With glittering scales shall the dolphins play.  When scarcely flutters the snowy sail,  Gently waved by the whispering gale,  I shall gaze in the ocean's liquid glass,  And mark the hidden treasures we pass:  The amber and coral groves that glow  In the sparkling sunbeams that dart below,  Whose lucid and spreading boughs between  Countless flitting forms are seen.  Oh! could I beneath the billows dive,  And in that world of splendour live!  Were there a cave for thee and me  Beneath that bright and silent sea,  Which waves conceal and rocks surround,  Like that the Island loves found*.  Strange and solemn was the hour  That saw them reach that secret bower;—  Some love-lorn seamaid's deep abode,  Or palace of the ocean god.  Long had Hoonga's inmost cells    Echoed to the mournful tone  Of the waves among the shells,    And the winds that feebly moan:  But never to music so sad, so sweet,  As the vows they breathed in that lone retreat.  But, ah! our bark glides swiftly on,  And my vision of that cave is gone,"".","yes, fictional."

However, populations exist from Alaska and into portions of the northwest United States including Washington, Idaho, the Dakotas, and Montana.  ""The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only."" How to Survive A Grizzly Attack

1. Carry bear pepper spray. Experts recommend that hikers in bear country carry with them bear pepper spray. UDAP bear pepper spray is a highly concentrated capsaicin spray that creates a large cloud. This stuff will usually stop a bear in it’s tracks.
2. Don’t run. When you run, the bear thinks you’re prey and will continue chasing you, so stand your ground. And don’t think you can out run a bear. Bears are fast. They can reach speeds of 30 mph. Unless you’re an Olympic sprinter, don’t bother running.
3. Drop to the ground in the fetal position and cover the back of your neck with your hands. If you don’t have pepper spray or the bear continues to charge even after the spray, this is your next best defense. Hit the ground immediately and curl into the fetal position.
4. Play dead. Grizzlies will stop attacking when they feel there’s no longer a threat. If they think you’re dead, they won’t think you’re threatening. Once the bear is done tossing you around and leaves, continue to play dead. Grizzlies are known for waiting around to see if their victim will get back up.",play dead.

Sai Baba is revered as an incarnation of Sri Dattatreya and considered as Saguna Brahma by his devotees. The prior incarnations of Dattatreya, namely, Divine Trinity,  Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, include Shripada Shri Vallabha around 1320 AD to 1350 AD and Shri Narasimha Saraswati around 1378 AD to 1458 AD.During Saibaba's lifetime in Shirdi, Sai Baba used to request some of his ardent devotees to read Guru Charitra (by Sri Saraswati Gangadhar Sakhare) and blessed them. To date, Sai devotees across the world read Guru Charitra with same fervor as they love and read Sai Satcharitra. Both Sai Satchritra and Guru Charitra in essence impart the same light and teachings but written during different time periods. We suggest all Sai devotees to listen, assimilate and drink the nectar of this holy work!Before listening to the Guru Charitra chapters, we request devotees to invoke Sai Baba and Dattatreya mentally infront of them and pray to them. While listening, you can say, Alexa Next,  Alexa Previous, Alexa Pause, Alexa Resume, Alexa Stop, to navigate through the chapters! May Sai and Dattatreya bless you!","yes, understood."

B07JK9HM9T,"Alexa, open guys talking women","Welcome to Guys  Talking  Women facts. Here's your facts... It goes like this. You see a cute girl, you want to say something, but then the annoying inner voice gets in the way, telling you that you’re not good enough or that the conversation is going to flop. Sound familiar?Well, you miss 100% of the shots that you don’t take. Letting that inner voice get the best of you is a guaranteed failure. So how can you combat that inner voice that’s bogging you down?Action Item #1: Develop a Replacement Mantra.Come up with a phrase or statement that you can use to replace that negative inner voice. Make it personal, meaningful and easy to remember. Here are some examples:My goal is to meet new people, regardless of the outcome. I’m in control of my actions, not other people’s reactions. I will never meet anyone if I don’t ever meet anyone. Action Item #2: Set Micro-Goals.It’s easy to get intimidated when it comes to approaching or talking with a woman you’re attracted to. Often times it’s because you’re playing out these ridiculous scenarios about how you’re going to fall in love at first sight and go horseback riding on the beach as your first date (which is kind of cool, now that I think about it). Rather than coming up with all these weird expectations, set achievable goals. Here are some examples:My goal is to simply say hello to that woman, even if the conversation goes no further. My goal is to introduce myself to one woman tonight.When you set goals that are specific, achievable and time bound, you’re much more likely to follow through. Action Item #3: Let Go of Outcomes.Similar to what I mentioned above, you’re often disappointed or scared of approaching people when you are attached to outcomes. You’re not a failure if a woman doesn’t want to go on a date with you or you stumble on a few words while chatting. When you release your emotional attachment to outcomes that you’re expecting, it takes pressure off of the situation. When you’re consumed with grandiose expectations you’ll get nervous and this will be subconsciously displayed through your body language, making the interaction even more awkward. So go into conversations with no expectations.",yes.

However, populations exist from Alaska and into portions of the northwest United States including Washington, Idaho, the Dakotas, and Montana.  ""The information in this skill is provided for informational and educational purposes only."" How to Survive A Grizzly Attack

1. Carry bear pepper spray. Experts recommend that hikers in bear country carry with them bear pepper spray. UDAP bear pepper spray is a highly concentrated capsaicin spray that creates a large cloud. This stuff will usually stop a bear in it’s tracks.
2. Don’t run. When you run, the bear thinks you’re prey and will continue chasing you, so stand your ground. And don’t think you can out run a bear. Bears are fast. They can reach speeds of 30 mph. Unless you’re an Olympic sprinter, don’t bother running.
3. Drop to the ground in the fetal position and cover the back of your neck with your hands. If you don’t have pepper spray or the bear continues to charge even after the spray, this is your next best defense. Hit the ground immediately and curl into the fetal position.
4. Play dead. Grizzlies will stop attacking when they feel there’s no longer a threat. If they think you’re dead, they won’t think you’re threatening. Once the bear is done tossing you around and leaves, continue to play dead. Grizzlies are known for waiting around to see if their victim will get back up.",follow instructions.

B07DQGCJD9,"Alexa, open heart sutra"," the heart sutra: Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, meditating deeply on Perfection of Wisdom, saw clearly that the five aspects of human existence are empty, and so released himself from suffering. Answering the monk Shariputra, he said this: Form is nothing more than emptiness, emptiness is nothing more than form. The form is exactly empty, and emptiness is exactly form. The other four aspects of human existence -- feeling, thought, will, and consciousness -- are likewise nothing more than emptiness, and emptiness nothing more than they. All things are empty: Nothing is born, nothing dies, nothing is pure, nothing is stained, nothing increases and nothing decreases. So, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no thought, no will, no consciousness. There are no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no seeing, no hearing, no smelling, no tasting, no touching, no imagining. There is nothing seen, nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted, nor touched, nor imagined. There is no ignorance, and no end to ignorance. There is no old age and death, and no end to old age and death. There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no end to suffering, no path to follow. There is no attainment of wisdom, and no wisdom to attain. The Bodhisattvas rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and so with no delusions, they feel no fear, and have Nirvana here and now. All the Buddhas, past, present, and future, rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and live in full enlightenment. The Perfection of Wisdom is the greatest mantra. It is the clearest mantra, the highest mantra, the mantra that removes all suffering. This is truth that cannot be doubted. Say it so: Ga tay, ga tay, para gatay, parasam gatay. Bodhi! Sva-ha! ","yes, truth."
B07DQGCJD9,"Alexa, open heart sutra","This might answer your question: Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality.

He travelled right around the world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were plenty of princesses, but whether they were real princesses he had great difficulty in discovering; there was always something which was not quite right about them. So at last he had come home again, and he was very sad because he wanted a real princess so badly. One evening there was a terrible storm; there was thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in torrents; indeed it was a fearful night.

Well we shall soon see if that is true , thought the old Queen, but she said nothing. She went into the bedroom, took all the bed clothes off and laid a pea on the bedstead: then she took twenty mattresses and piled them on top of the pea, and then twenty feather beds on top of the mattresses.

Okay! , said the wolf. I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down. So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the straw house down. 
The little pig was so scared he ran to his brother's stick house. He told him about the wolf and they hid under the table. Once again, the wolf shouted, little pigs, little pigs, let me in. Should the two little pigs let the wolf in? ",yes

Well well, he said, I was not expecting that. This is certainly not how the story was supposed to end. He then turned back and disappeared into the dark woods. The third little pig ran home terrified and told his mother what happened, but there was nothing they could do. This is the sad end of the story, please try again to get to the happy ending!

B07ZZ62VT2,"Alexa, open Jazmin's day","Jazmin often fails to surface from her latest sleeping place until around 9am, and immediately heads to the kitchen, where she expects a new packet of wet food to be put down in front of her. Jazmin believes that even if the food was put down only a few moments before she entered the kitchen, it is too old for her to eat. It is also unnacceptable for Jazmin to be able to see the bottom of her dish at any time. Once fed and watered, Jazmin decides to watch birds out of the lounge window and sunbathe if it is sunny, or go and have a chat with her owners. If Jazmin is feeling unsociable, she will curl up somewhere and go back to sleep, only getting up to eat againAround lunchtime, Jazmin often goes around the house to check that the housework has been carried out to meet her standards. If something has been missed, Jazmin soon makes this known. Once satisfied, Jazmin heads to the kitchen for lunch.  In the afternoon, Jazmin watches one of her servents leave for work; she needs to make sure that they have gone. Jazmin then has time to herself to do who-knows-what. As soon as Jazmin hears her servant return home in the evening, she runs to see her, demanding strokes and cuddles straight away. This is often shown by Jazmin laying accross the floor in a variety of poses.  If her servant happens to return home late, Jazmin is sat waiting by the door looking mad, and starts complaining the second the front door opens. Later on in the evening, after cuddles and a bit more food, Jazmin jumps up onto her servants computer desk, to watch and help with whatever her servant may be doing online. Having recently completed a Business degree alongside her servant, Jazmin is currently very excited by computer programming,  web design and development. She is greatly enjoying building Alexa skills.  After a busy day, Jazmin gets ready for her servant going to bed around midnight. If her servant chooses to stay up later, Jazmin often decides that this isnt good enough, and complains, leaving the computer and sitting in the bedroom complaining until her servant goes down to bed. Once her servant is tucked up in bed, Jazmin leaves the room satisfied, and goes off to sleep in one of her many cat beds, until the next day.  I hope you enjoyed hearing about Jazmin's day.  Thankyou for listening and goodbye.",thank you. goodbye.

B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," The known history of Lithuania dates to roughly 2000 years B C, around the time when the first artefacts were found. The people in the area were mostly hunters and gatherers. They were pagans and worshipped fire along with other wonders of the nature. One thing is certain though, they were living there together with Mother Earth. Back then they were known as aistians or aesti and were first mentioned by Tacit in 98 b c as people that collect and trade amber.Are you ready for the next chapter? ",yes.
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania", The first mention of Lithuania as such in writing was not the most pleasant one. When Bruno of Querfurt tried to convert them to Christianity in 1009 a.d. He was beheaded as the people didn’t want to give up their traditions and they remained the last pagans in Europe.Want to go to the next chapter? ,"yes, please."
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," The beginning of the end for paganism started when Mindaugas, the first and only King of Lithuania, got baptised and declared the Lithuania a Christian country in 1253. Interestingly after his death, ten years later, the country completely rejected the idea of Christianity and remained pagans until other Grand Dukes came to rule, over a hundred years later!  You've unlocked a secret fact. Want to hear it? ","yes, please."
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," Lithuanian is a very old language. In fact, it is the least changed Indo-European language in the world, that was faced with extinction various times.

B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," The Grand Duchy of Lithuania constantly expanded by winning wars and securing diplomatic ties, such as marrying into the families of rulers of other lands. After the rule of Veetautas, in the 15th century, it became the biggest country in Europe spanning from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, engulfing current Lithuania, Belarus, Poland and Ukraine. Ready to move to the next chapter? ",yes.
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," The most famous battle was that of Grunwald. Joint forces of Lithuania and Poland led by Vytautas defeated the Teutonic Order there. It's one of the grandest fights during the middle ages, about which stories are being told until this day. It became a symbol of fight against intruders, the most monumental battle in Lithuania's history.  You've unlocked a secret fact. Want to hear it? ","yes, please."
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania"," Lithuanians were known for their bravery and sense of freedom. An event signifying that was the loss of a fight in Peelenai castle. Once Lithuanians were defeated and outnumbered against the Teutonic order, they would rather die than become slaves. The Duke and the company inside burned all the valuables inside the castle, took their wives and children's lives and finally took their own. All in the name of freedom, not to let Teutonic Order have their way and take them into slavery. The tale of their bravery is told to this day.That was a cool fact.

Throughout the years, the lands kept getting smaller and smaller as the Commonwealth was being attacked by its enemies. Lithuania faced another difficulty. In the joint country, the nobility spoke only Polish and the Lithuanian language was considered that of a peasant. In other words, Lithuanians were losing their national identity. That's why it's incredible that the Lithuanian language and culture survived to this day.  You've unlocked a secret fact. Want to hear it? ","yes, please."
B0796GLPNS,"Alexa, open Journey of Lithuania", Lithuania was the very last country to be baptised in Europe and were very close with Mother Nature. Our naturalistic roots lie within us to this day.

B0BLYTRL61,"Alexa, open Kitesurf Central","Situated in an outstanding location, Langebaan On Sea is a 1-minutes walk from Langebaan Main Beach and 2-minutes walk to all popular restaurants and shops. Langebaan On Sea is owner managed by Warren and Helen and we have a wealth of local knowledge on the area. We pride ourselves in being friendly, hospitable and warm. We hope you have an outstanding and memorable stay with us at Langebaan On Sea and look forward to welcoming you. Would you like directions to us from Cape Town?",yes
B0BLYTRL61,"Alexa, open Kitesurf Central","From Cape Town, take the N7 towards Melkbosstrand. Take exit 31 off the N7. This will bring you onto the M19 towards Melkbosstrand. Travel down the M19 for about 8.2 kilometers. You will reach a set of traffic lights. Turn right at these lights onto the R27. You will travel dow the R27 for about 87 kilometers. You will the see an Engen Petroleum station on your left hand side. Just as you pass the petroleum station, turn left at the Langebaan sign onto Oostewal Road. Travel straight down Oostewal Road for about 10.7 kilometers. You will pass through the heart of Langebaan. You will pass a small shopping centre witha Spar store on your left after about 10 kilometers. After another 600 meters you will pass a police station on your left. We are in Enderstein Street which is the very first road to the right after the police station. Finding us has never been easier! Would you like to hear about the kitesurfing beaches near us?",yes.
B0BLYTRL61,"Alexa, open Kitesurf Central","Langebaan is an absolute kitesurfing mecca. From the end of September until the end of March, thousands of international visitors from Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands visit us to experience the thrill of powerful winds that make for great kiting and foiling. There are 2 kiting beaches to choose from along the beautiful shoreline of Langebaan Lagoon. The first, is Langebaan Main Beach which is a short 1 minute walk from our guest house. Langebaan Main Beach offers large expanses of water for kiting. The current here can be strong and the wind can fluctuate in intensity from very strong to mild. Your kiting expertise will be tested to the full at times. The second beach is called Shark Bay. It's called Shark Bay because of the colony of sand sharks. These sharks are completely harmless and shy away from people. Shark Bay offers a slightly more protected environment from the Main Beach and is especially good for beginners and those wanting a less hectic day out. It also offers a coffee shop and a great stretch of beach for those simply wanting to lie and relax in the sun. Would you like to hear about the kitesurfing school and equipment hire places we recommend?",yes.
B0BLYTRL61,"Alexa, open Kitesurf Central","We have 2 kite school and equipment hire recommendations for you based on their expertise and professionalism. It is worth bearing in mind that you should try to book any lesson or kiting gear with them before your holiday. Langebaan gets extremely busy with kiters in-season and you will risk not being able to book lessons or gear if you wait until you arrive here. Here are our recommendations. 1. Obsession Kiting. Obsession Kiting is the only female owned kite school in Langebaan. This family owned business is situated just a 30 second walk from the main kiting beach. Owners Shannon and Megz offer beginner, refresher and advanced courses daily. Email Shannon at Obsession kiting.sea oh dot zed A to book your lessons. Kite gear available for both hire and purchase include everything from  helmets and harnesses to boards, kites and more. Obsession Kiting also have a shop for browsing a selection of bikinis, tees and other cool beachware. Our second suggestion is the kite school at Windtown Hotel which is a gentle 90 second stroll from our guest house. From private kite lockers, to Duotone kite equipment rental and sale, from private lessons to a rescue boat service, Windtown offer great expertise and service Monday's to Sunday's. They even offer sup hire for those windless days on the lagoon. Find them online under Kite School Windtown Langebaan. Would you like to find out about Langebaan weather and what to pack for your holiday?",yes.
B0BLYTRL61,"Alexa, open Kitesurf Central","The weather in Langebaan between the months of November and the end of March is generally very dry, with little rain. Like the rest of Cape Town, you can expect extended periods of strong winds, although there are days when the wind won't blow at all. Temperatures can vary with highs of around 22 degrees in November. The warmer weather begins in December with temperatures averaging 26 degrees until the end of January. February and March are the hottest months with temperatures often climbing to between 32 and 36 degrees. It's important to pack light clothing - shorts, t-shirts, summer dresses and skirts. A jacket or hoodie to combat the wind is also a good idea. Footwear should be no more than sandals, open shoes - in fact, you probably won't wear shoes much at all. The sun in Langebaan is extremely harsh and will begin to burn your skin within 30 minutes. Definitely book an excellent sun cream or lotion with a sun protection factor of 50. An after-sun lotion is also advisable.",yes.

B07DL7TH1S,"Alexa, open Klondike Solitaire"," Welcome to Klondike Solitaire for Echo Show. Since this is your first time here, let me give you some instructions. The basic rules of Klondike Solitaire are simple, you can move cards only on top of cards that are one rank higher than themselves, and only of an alternating color. To move a card, say, 'move the ace of spades to the 2 of clubs'.You win by putting all the cards in the stacks at the top, in ascending order by suit. Say, 'move the ace of spades to the stack' to move a card to the top pile.You can only play kings on empty piles. Say, 'play the king of diamonds on the empty pile'. Lastly, you draw more cards to play by saying, 'draw cards'. Also, remember that you can interrupt by saying my name, then your command, instead of waiting for the what is your move prompt. This makes it easy for me to give you enough time to think, then you can wake me when you are ready to make a move.

I’ve done hundreds of consultations with students who want to pay me their hard-earned money to help them pass the bar exam. One of the first questions I ask is whether they have reached out to the Academic Support Department of their law school. I don’t actually keep track of the statistics here, but I would be willing to bet that around 90% of them have not. Many times, students say they don’t want to because they are embarrassed. Listen, not reaching out for help because you are embarrassed is like being on fire and not asking someone to dump water on you because you don’t want to bother them. Stupid and harmful. Your law school should be your very first stop with your bar exam news. First, talking to them is free because you’ve already given them all your money, so they should be helping you! Second, they can help you evaluate your results and come up with a new strategy. Third, they can help you deal with your bar review company if they are giving you a hard time with your repeater course. Fourth, discounts. That’s right, many law schools have special discounts on supplemental bar review resources that you will miss out on if you never call them. Finally, they care about you passing the bar exam. Hopefully, because they are good people and care about you as a person, but also because bar passage is important to the reputation of the school.","yes, reach out."
